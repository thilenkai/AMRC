## General information:

R Markdown conveniently combines R code with textual explanations (in
Latex or html coding). This will be useful for our exercises, but is
really useful in general when you would like to have documented R
output. Solve the tasks with R code, and place short comments to answer
the questions. There is no need for producing a fancy document. Keep
things as simple as possible. Always show the (relevant) R code - never
hide it.

R and R-Studio need to be installed, as well as \LaTeX (e.g. for Windows
as Miktex <https://miktex.org/> and for Linux as TexLive
<https://www.tug.org/texlive/>). Then open this file in R-Studio with
*File - Open File*, and press the button *Knit*. The result is a pdf
file.

**Submit both, the R Markdown file and the pdf file to TUWEL.**

# Some simple examples:

## Load and plot data:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
data(Auto,package="ISLR")
x <- Auto[,-9]
```

Plot the selected data, with origin as color and symbol:

```{r, echo=TRUE,fig.width=6,fig.height=4}
plot(x, col=x$origin, pch=x$origin)
```

## Estimate the correlation matrix of the numeric variables

Pearson: investigates linear relationsships (default)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
cor.pearson <- cor(x)
```

Kendall: investigates non-linear relationsships

```{r, echo=TRUE}
cor.kendall <- cor(x, method = "kendall")
```

Do eigen-decomposition and compare eigenvalues:

```{r, echo=TRUE,fig.width=4,fig.height=4}
eigen.pearson <- eigen(cor.pearson)
eigen.kendall <- eigen(cor.kendall)
plot(eigen.pearson$values,eigen.kendall$values,
     xlab="Eigenvalues from Pearson",ylab="Eigenvalues from Kendall")
abline(c(0,1),col=4,lty=2)
```
